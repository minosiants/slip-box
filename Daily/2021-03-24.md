going through `racket programming the fun way`  

racket has only one type for numbers it can have any value

functions that determine type 
`integer?`
`reational?`
`real?`
`complex?`

just now realized that `flooring` and `ceiling` functions referring to floor and ceiling :)



at-exp notation `@${1+2*3}`
